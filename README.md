# AndroidMUI5 – Jetchat Extensions (SMS & Voice to Text)

AndroidMUI5 is an extended version of the official **Jetchat** sample app from Google, enhanced with:

- Multiple **SMS Inbox** visualizations (V1–V5)
- A rich **Voice to Text lab** (V1–V4) built with Jetpack Compose and Android’s `SpeechRecognizer`
- A collapsible **navigation drawer** with neatly organized sections for Chats, SMS versions, and Voice-to-Text versions

The goal of this project is to **experiment with UI/UX patterns** for text-based communication and speech input, while staying clean, modern, and easy for new developers to extend.

### 📱 SMS Inbox Variants (V1–V5)

These are useful to:
- Compare list designs
- Try different item visuals (chips, cards, dividers)
- Test how a consistent navigation pattern handles multiple versions

### 🎙 Voice to Text Lab (V1–V4)

All Voice screens use Android’s **`SpeechRecognizer` API** and runtime **RECORD_AUDIO permission**.

#### 🔹 V1 – Simple Voice to Text

`VoiceToTextScreenV1`

- Clean, minimal UI
- A single button to **start/stop listening**
- One big text box showing the **accumulated transcript**
- **Clear** and **Copy** actions at the bottom

Use case: simplest “dictation pad” experience.

---

#### 🔹 V2 – Session Card + Transcript

`VoiceToTextScreenV2`

- Center-aligned Top App Bar: `Voice to Text – V2`
- Top **“Session” card** with:
  - Status text (Listening / Speak now / Tap to start again)
  - Tonal **Start/Stop Listening** button
- Secondary **Transcript** card:
  - Header: “Transcript”
  - Scrollable area with full text
- **Clear** & **Copy** buttons

Use case: more “professional” / clinic-style dictation UI.

---

#### 🔹 V3 – Live Text + History + Floating Mic

`VoiceToTextScreenV3`

- Emphasis on **live, streaming speech recognition**
- Uses `EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS = true`
- UI Layout:
  - Card for **Live text** (current partial result)
  - Card for **Transcript history** (finalized sentences)
  - Centered **FloatingActionButton mic** at bottom
- Bottom row: **Clear** and **Copy**

Use case: when user wants to watch text appear while speaking, and see past sentences separately.

---

#### 🔹 V4 – Chat Bubble Style with Per-Bubble Editing

`VoiceToTextScreenV4`

- Each recognized sentence is converted into a **chat-style bubble**
- Bubbles are right-aligned (as if user messages)
- **Partial (live) text** shown as a faded bubble while speaking
- Top status line: “Tap the mic and start speaking”
- **Floating mic FAB** for start/stop
- **Per-bubble options**:
  - Three-dot (⋮) menu on each bubble
  - **Edit** – opens dialog to modify the text
  - **Delete** – removes that bubble
- App bar action: **Copy all**, which joins all bubbles + live text

Use case: when you want spoken sentences to behave like editable chat messages.
